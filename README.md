# About me
Hi everyone, my name is Aleksandra Szafranska, but just call me Ola. I am a student and I study chemical
analytics at the Technical University of Lodz. Currently, I am studying to be a software tester. I am not discouraged by the amount of topics to learn, because I love to acquire new knowledge. I am in the process of uTest Academy, and in my free time I test various websites. I would like to develop myself in web application testing and I am open to gain knowledge about test automation. Any comments are welcome, after all, believing that there is no mistake is a mistake ;)
